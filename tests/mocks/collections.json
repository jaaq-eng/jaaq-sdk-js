          "transcription": "So this is something that I am very up and down with.I think for me it shows up in the waythat I have certain safe foods.So I think the best way to describe it isa lot of the time, if I'm just going about my life,if I'm doing normal things,then I have a fairly normal relationship with food.I think there's certain textures that I would always avoid.Anything that's a bit, I dunno, slimy or strange,but I think if there's a lot going on in my lifeand everything else feels unpredictable,then I don't have the energy left to dealwith food being unpredictable either.So for example, if I've fallen out with a friendor if I've got really busy week at work,or if there's a lot going on, that all feels unpredictable.So if I'm then to eat a piece of fruit that might be crunchyor might be a bit soggy, that uncertaintyand that not getting what I expect is goingto tip me over the edge.So I tend to have certain foods that I know are always goingto give me the same thing.Like a chicken nugget is always goingto be a chicken nugget, A bagelis always going to be a bagel.It's quite predictable what you're going to get.It's less risk of that being the one thingthat's going to tip me over the edge.So even if I can't predict if my friend's going to fall outwith me, if my project's going to go well at work,if I'm going to be tired from doing something, I still knowthat a bagel is a bagel.And I think a lot of autistic people have these kindof safe foods that they return back towhen things feel like a lot.I think another thing that we strugglewith is getting the signals from our bodies.So whereas a normal person might get a natural signalof being hungry, my body kindof doesn't naturally tell me that.So if it's lunchtimeand then everybody else is eating, then I kindof get the signal from everybody else eating that, oh,it's lunchtime, I must be hungry, I should eat.But if I am maybe alone at home, not around other peopleand I don't have that structure,then I won't naturally think to eat.I can just go and go and goand then suddenly think, ohmy goodness, I've not had any lunch.So I think the way the food that we eat can be more unusual,and I think the way that we know to eat can needreminders from the outside as well.",

The information come fromthat vagus nerve, the wander nerve all throughout the body.That's what the wee hum is doing.And it's going to move your diaphragm, it's goingto move your lungs, your ribcage, all of thatwith the spinal movement.All of these are going to help makethat brain feel a little bit calmerand a little bit more at home and safer in your environment.",

Moving mad, erratic attitude being. Ridiculous, but then there will be times when I'm journaling, seeing a therapist, counsellor, going on peace walks. It's a mixed bag, so like, I like to focus on the positive side of of doing it, but. Yeah man, like trying to see a counsellor, doing my research, listening to positive things, feeding my brain in the right way, sometimes like listening to nothing and just asking myself how do I feel? Journaling and just writing and being like I don't know what to write and just literally writing, I don't know what to write. And any thoughts that come in my head just writing because trying to get aligned within myself is super important because I haven't been. Because when I'm acting a certain way and I don't understand why I'm acting a certain way, who else is gonna really tell me cos no one knows my intrinsic thoughts but me. But sometimes getting it out on a paper, getting it out on a piece of paper, helps me like understand because my hand can only move so fast, so I have to stay channelled to my hands, I have to stay locked in and. They've been like some of the best tactics I've done to like help me deal with like anything that I'm going through, um. Yeah, and I've been like a really good support network. But I'm not talking about like a group of friends who are like popular who can go out or whatever. I'm talking about friends you can have a real conversation and be like yo bro, I'm feeling anxious. What do you think about this? Them being educated and caring about certain things too, do you know what I mean like them kind of friends. That hold you accountable, be like, bro, that's not what you do, bro, that's not you. Or these friends that let you have your moment as well, do you know what I mean, and then reel you in after them kind of like support networks are. Money can't buy.",

Some, some rappers said it, but I knew from an early age, obviously growing up where I grew up, hella man, are just faking it till they make it, but because they fake it so well, everyone else just believes them, and then later on, if they do the work that they're supposed to, they end up being the person that they were faking to be anyway, so I'm kinda like. Hm. But in terms of like my confidence in my career and stuff, I've always been a confident player because I've always loved playing basketball. I've always loved it, um. Watching basketball, studying it, like I'd watch it on a video tape and I'd rewind it, watch it, rewind it, watch it, rewind it, like it was just, it was so intense so I always had faith in my skills. It was a little bit tough though when I thought I worked hard. And I didn't, because when you start getting better and better, you're playing against better players, so you're like a big fish in a small ponds, then you're like a tiny fish in a big pond. What I didn't have was being that tiny fish in a big pond. I didn't have the level of confidence in the hard work that I was gonna put in to be able to be a big fish in that big pond. And I only came like later on in my career because I thought I knew what it took to work hard. And I didn't until I ended up in situations with. Players that really worked hard and I had to like make a conscious decision of yeah I'm getting killed today, but how, how come, or maybe if I put the work in I won't get killed as much tomorrow or in a month or in 6 weeks or in a year we'll just see where we're at and trusting in that process so. The confidence was a little bit up and down for me, it'd be great when I played well, but then it'd be bad when I played bad. So trying to find out that even kill was always like really tough for me, but I finally got there, it's sometimes it's rocky but. Yeah, just not having my confidence reliant on my performance. My confidence needs to be my confidence and we do what we can to support that.",

But it's, it doesn't work like that. If anything, you probably need to do less, you need to just accept who you are within this moment of where you're at, which is so nuts, like it's absolutely bananas. Impostor syndrome used to have me in a chokehold, it was crazy because. Nothing I ever did was good enough. I, I've had games where I've missed one shot. I'm breaking records, everyone's like, oh my God, I wanna be like you blah blah blah. I can't remember the shots I've made, I only remember the one shot because something is telling me like you don't, you don't deserve this, you don't deserve that, you've gotta work harder, I'm always pushing the goalpost further and it was just burning me out, man, and like I just got over it at a point where nothing was was good enough. I was miserable all the time. I didn't like what I was doing, anything that I did do that was good was crazy and the worst thing was, because I'm talented and I work hard, I'm performing well. And I don't feel like I deserve to be performing well because I need to work harder, but then I work harder to the point of burnout, and then when you get to burnout, now I start performing worse because I'm exhausted and I'm knackered mentally and physically and then. Because I'm performing bad, now my brain's like told you all the success you had you didn't deserve. That was a fluke. This is where you're at. And then once I'm down in the dumps, then I've got to drag myself up out of that to perform, to get back to where I was, only to know that when I get back to performing at a great level, the Impostor syndrome's gonna be like, you don't deserve this, we're going back down there anyway. So it was just a revolving cycle which was. Just jarring and I'm just like bro, if the ball goes in it goes in. If it don't, it don't move. So yeah, Iostor syndrome. It's a real one. Don't have it anymore, not as much, but yeah, it's just something that I'm always gonna battle with I think just because I feel like it can be great and there's so many amazing things that I wanna achieve.",

I still performed, which made it worse because the habits that I developed. Reinforced the nonsense I was doing. Which was not so like. On game days and stuff, I'd have such anxiety going into games where I've been playing basketball, like they talk about 10,000 hours when you're like an expert, smash that, absolutely smash it, but before games, I'm getting that high level of anxiety where I'm gonna forget how to catch the ball, forget how to dribble, forget how to shoot. Forget the plays, I'm gonna mess everything up. Everyone else is gonna play perfect and I'm gonna be the one who's gonna destroy everything, so I'm like, oh, but I don't know where that came from, probably because I'm such a perfectionist where I'm like I need to be the best I can be because the better I play, the better stats I have, the better stats I have, the better chance the team's gonna win. The more we win the more eyes are gonna get looked at the team, the more eyes are gonna get looked at me. Better teams and better countries, more money, keep climbing up the ranks. That's how it was, it was like a it was a snowball of like thoughts all the time, to the point where game days we would have shoot around in the morning as a team, then we'd have to be back for like team shoot around at like 5:45 for a 7:30 game. I'm stretching, rolling at home, I'm watching Kobe Bryant motivational videos, I'm taking my nap and then I'm turning up to the arena 2 hours before the team shoot around because I'm like I need to practise every single thing that I could potentially do in the game and see the ball go through the basket so that I've ticked every single box so that when it's time for the game, I'm, I'm good. It's kinda like studying for an exam and all the stuff you've had to study throughout the whole year. You cram every every single thing just before the test, like an hour before the test. It's the worst thing to do, absolute worst, and I was doing that with basketball to the point where I'm exhausted before the game because I've done like 3 hours of working out on game day, and now I'm about to do a 45 minute workout with the team, then play for 2 hours. So obviously for me not to be so exhausted. I'm taking like 23 red balls, I'm eating Harry balls, so I've got like sugar just running through me, you get me, I'm wired, I'm locked in, I'm shooting shots and the other team are coming in and they're seeing me working out. They're like, yeah, Kofi's locked in, but they don't know, they think Kofi's focused and he's like yeah he's gonna kill today. They don't know, I'm just making sure I'm ticking every single box just so I can have a good game and I don't mess up. And then it slowly goes from that to I'm a killer. Do you know what I mean? And like from there it was just bad so now I'm not doing none of that. I trust in my ability, I trust in all the hard work I've done, I journal, I listen to positive motivational videos. And I'll just have faith where balls either go in or it's not. If it goes in we move on, if it don't go in, we move on. And that kind of gives me a sense of calm and peace of just do your best and see what happens. Like there's certain games in my life where I thought the world was going to end because I had a bad game. You asked me what game that was now, I can't even remember and life's been rolling anyway, so that kind of gives me that level of of confidence now and that's uh. Something that I do to like handle the mental pressure currently.",
